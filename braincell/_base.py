"""
Base classes and core components for modeling neurons and ion channels in the BrainCell library.

This module defines the fundamental classes and structures for creating Hodgkin-Huxley type
neuron models and various ion channels. It provides a hierarchical structure that allows
for the creation of complex, biologically accurate neural simulations.

Class Hierarchy:
----------------

1. HHTypedNeuron
   Base class for Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models.
   - SingleCompartment (not defined in this file)
     A subclass representing a single-compartment neuron model.

2. IonChannel
   Base class for all ion channel types.
   
   - Ion
     Base class for specific ion channels.
     - Calcium
       Represents calcium ion channels.
     - Potassium
       Represents potassium ion channels.
     - Sodium
       Represents sodium ion channels.
   
   - MixIons
     Represents channels that involve multiple ion types.
   
   - Channel
     A generic channel class, possibly for custom or complex channel types.

Key Components:
---------------
- HHTypedNeuron: The foundation for creating Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models.
  It manages ion channels and provides methods for current calculation and state updates.

- IonChannel: The base class for all ion channel types, defining the interface
  for channel behavior including current calculation and state management.

- Ion: Specializes IonChannel for specific ion types (Calcium, Potassium, Sodium).
  Each subclass represents the dynamics of its respective ion.

- MixIons: Allows for the creation of channels that involve multiple ion types,
  useful for modeling more complex channel behaviors.

- Channel: A generic channel class that can be used for custom channel types or
  as a base for more specific channel implementations.

This structure allows for a flexible and extensible framework for modeling various
types of neurons and ion channels, from simple single-compartment models to more
complex multi-compartment or custom channel configurations.

Usage:
------
Users can subclass these base classes to create specific neuron models or ion channel
types, leveraging the provided structure and methods to implement detailed, biologically
accurate simulations.

Note:
-----
The actual implementations of some classes (e.g., SingleCompartment, specific Ion subclasses)
may be defined in other files within the BrainCell library.

    Base class for modeling ion channel dynamics in neuronal simulations.

    The IonChannel class serves as a foundation for implementing various types of ion channels,
    including those for specific ions (e.g., sodium, potassium) or mixtures of ions. It provides
    a structure for defining the behavior and properties of ion channels within a neuron model.

    This class is designed to be subclassed to create specific ion channel models. Subclasses
    should implement the core methods to define the channel's behavior, such as current calculation,
    state initialization, and derivative computation.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    in_size : tuple
        The dimensions of the ion channel, representing its size (e.g., number of neurons,
        number of compartments).
    out_size : tuple
        Same as in_size, representing the output dimensions of the channel.
    name : str, optional
        A name identifier for the ion channel.

    Methods:
    --------
    varshape : property
        Returns the shape of the channel's variables.
    current(*args, **kwargs)
        Calculate the current flow through the channel. Must be implemented by subclasses.
    pre_integral(*args, **kwargs)
        Perform operations before the integration step in simulations.
    compute_derivative(*args, **kwargs)
        Compute the derivatives of the channel's state variables. Must be implemented by subclasses.
    post_integral(*args, **kwargs)
        Perform operations after the integration step in simulations.
    init_state(*args, **kwargs)
        Initialize the state variables of the channel. Must be implemented by subclasses.
    reset_state(*args, **kwargs)
        Reset the state variables to their initial values. Must be implemented by subclasses.

    Notes:
    ------
    - Subclasses should override the abstract methods (current, compute_derivative, init_state,
      reset_state) to define the specific behavior of the ion channel.
    - The class integrates with the broader neuron modeling framework, allowing for complex
      simulations of neuronal dynamics.
    - It's designed to work within a hierarchical structure of neuronal components, as indicated
      by its inheritance from TreeNode.

        This method calculates the sum of currents from all Channel nodes within the
        MixIons instance. It iterates through each channel, computes its individual
        current, and aggregates them.
    
        Parameters:
        -----------
        V : array-like
            The membrane potential for all neurons in the simulation. This is typically
            a numpy array or similar structure containing voltage values.
    
        Returns:
        --------
        array-like or float
            The total current generated by all channels. If there are no channels,
            it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns an array-like object of the same
            shape as V, representing the summed current at each point.
    
        Notes:
        ------
        - The method retrieves all Channel nodes and their corresponding ion information.
        - For each channel, it calls the channel's current method with the membrane
          potential and relevant ion information.
